# About

This is an online map generator, written for fun to test some procedural generation methods. This project was inspired by [Scott Turner's](https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/), [Amit Patel's](https://www.redblobgames.com/) and [Martin O'Leary's](https://mewo2.com/) blogs.

This is written and Typescript and React, and uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) for Delaunay triangulation.

Please note that this is a very early-stage work in project and its features are therefore limited.
Next planned improvements are rainfall generation, river generation and town generation.
